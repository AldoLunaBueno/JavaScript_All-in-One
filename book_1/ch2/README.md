(There is no good way to install this program yet)

## Usage

Include gamelet.js in a HTML document containing an element with an id of "ball". Example:

``` html
<div id="ball"></div>
<script src="gamelet.js">
```

The script will respond when you press certain keyboard keys (W, A, S, D) by moving the ball element in a direction.

- W -> Up
- S -> Down
- A -> Left
- D -> Right
